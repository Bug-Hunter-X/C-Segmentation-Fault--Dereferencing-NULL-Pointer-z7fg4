This repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates a common programming error: dereferencing a NULL pointer. The program initializes an integer variable and a pointer to it. After setting the pointer to NULL, the program attempts to dereference it, resulting in a segmentation fault. The solution shows how to avoid this error by checking if the pointer is NULL before dereferencing it.
